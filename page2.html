      <p>Music should be playing as soon as you start reading this. I'm just saying hehe.

        Well hello there, my sweetheart. I just wanted to tell you I love you for everything that you've ever done and do for me. I read your letters after a long time and we do really have different forms of love don't we. 

    We may not always agree on everything. Especially, me. I'd just like to shamelessly request for you to bear with me through it all. I'm still immature and very much in need of your love and warmth. Please, Christine.

    I'll love you always in every way I know. I'm beyond overjoyed to have made these many memories with you. And they're special because I made them with you. Thank you, once again, now and forever hehe.</p>


    <p>You're the most beautiful girl in the world and I'm going to spend each lifetime I have with you. You're hot, sexy as hell, and so attractive I'm on a chokehold 24/7. You're the kindest person I know and the most interesting, and I'll never ever have enough of your cute ass.</p>

    <p> Lots of love(LOL) taya </p>
